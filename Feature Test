Chapter 9
----------
There is a different between testing code
and testing features

unit test are basically White Box

Feature test - also called Black Box/integration/system/e2e tests

Write a simple rest api test to handle api feature test
in python,we will use request api just to know how pytest can do simple api test
not api testing

1. we use most popular package called 'requests' of all time
2. provides simple api to called programs
3. example: Here, DuckDuckGo api is used

To Install in cmd > pip install requests

# Extending pytest with plugins

html report
-------------
1. pytest-html plugin
# to install -> pip install pytest-html
# to use -> python -m pytest --html=report.html
# customizable

Code Coverage
-------------
2. pytest-cov plugin
# to install -> pip install pytest-cov
# to use -> python -m pytest --cov=stuff
# to use on more than one file -> python -m pytest --cov=stuff --cov=tests
# to use with report -> python -m pytest --cov=stuff --cov-report html
# reports generated in dir htmlcov

Running Tests in Parallel
-------------------------
# by default pytest runs test on at a time
3. pytest-xdist plugin

# to install -> pip install pytest-xdist
# note: test cases must be independent cause failure
# to use -> python -m pytest -n 3 (-n is 'no. of threads to run')

# it can even distributed test execution across multiple machines using SSH or sockets
# ref doc in pytest


BDD - Test Case in Gherkin Style
---------------------------------
4. pytest-bdd plugin
# to install -> pip install pytest-bdd
# to use -> python -m pytest?? ref BDD
